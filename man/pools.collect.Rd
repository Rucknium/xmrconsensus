\description{
Uses the \code{monero-blocks} tool to continuously collect data from mining
pools' APIs about which Monero blocks they have claimed to mine. Data is
written to a CSV file named \code{blocks.csv}.

The \code{monero-blocks} Go program must be built in a 'monero-blocks'
local working directory. Available at
\url{https://git.gammaspectra.live/WeebDataHoarder/monero-blocks}

This function is an infinite loop. Input \code{ctrl + c} to interrupt.
